## Features

- Reads out arbitrary text using Zundamon's voice.
- Other character voices are also available.

## Server

To use this, please start the VOICEVOX local server.

1. Download and install [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/)
2. Start the VOICEVOX engine (an HTTP server will start on port 50021). If accessing from the [GitHub Pages version](https://cat2151.github.io/voicevox-playground), use the following command to allow CORS:

   ```bash
   <your VOICEVOX directory>/vv-engine/run --cors_policy_mode all --allow_origin https://cat2151.github.io
   ```

   When developing, if you also want to use it from the local development server (provided by `npm run dev` at `http://localhost:5173`), append `http://localhost:5173` to the above command:

   ```bash
   <your VOICEVOX directory>/vv-engine/run --cors_policy_mode all --allow_origin https://cat2151.github.io http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Usage

1. Start VOICEVOX (as described above)
2. Open the [application](https://cat2151.github.io/voicevox-playground) in your browser
3. Enter the text you want to be read aloud into the text area
4. The audio will be played.
5. You can edit the intonation.

## How it Works
- The webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages.
- From the webpage:
  - Requests are sent to the VOICEVOX local HTTP server (port 50021) to obtain audio data.
  - Audio is played using Tone.js v15.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
