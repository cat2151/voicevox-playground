## Features

- Reads out any text using Zundamon's voice
    - You can also choose voices from other characters.

## Target Platforms

- Works in any environment where a browser and VOICEVOX can be used.

## Server Setup

To use this application, you need to start the VOICEVOX local server.

1. Download and install [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/)
2. Start the VOICEVOX engine (an HTTP server will start on port 50021). If you are accessing from the [GitHub Pages version](https://cat2151.github.io/voicevox-playground), use the following command with CORS enabled:

   ```bash
   <your VOICEVOX directory>/vv-engine/run --cors_policy_mode all --allow_origin https://cat2151.github.io
   ```

   When developing, if you also want to use it from the local development server (provided by `npm run dev` at `http://localhost:5173`), append `http://localhost:5173` to the above command.

   ```bash
   <your VOICEVOX directory>/vv-engine/run --cors_policy_mode all --allow_origin https://cat2151.github.io http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Usage

1. Start VOICEVOX (as described above)
2. Open the [application](https://cat2151.github.io/voicevox-playground) in your browser
3. Enter the text you want to be read aloud into the text area
4. The audio will play
5. You can edit the intonation

## How it Works

- The webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages.
- From the webpage:
  - Sends requests to the VOICEVOX local HTTP server (port 50021) and retrieves audio data in response.
  - Plays audio using Tone.js v15.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Preview
npm run preview
```

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tone.js v15
- VOICEVOX API

## Project Goals

- To demonstrate that VOICEVOX can be operated from a webpage, allowing anyone to easily "vibecode" their own VOICEVOX client application!
- To achieve "instant sound playback by just opening the webpage and clicking" (provided the VOICEVOX server is already running).

## Out of Scope

- To be the ultimate VOICEVOX client application
- To accept and implement feature requests from users other than the developer
